## Overview

The `SpiderManGame` contract is a simple Solidity smart contract representing a game where Spiderman engages with a villain. It allows the initiation of a game, marking villains as defeated, and ending the game.

## Contract Structure

The contract consists of the following key elements:

- **State Variables:**
  - `spiderMan`: Address of Spiderman.
  - `villain`: Address of the current villain.
  - `gameInProgress`: Boolean flag indicating whether the game is in progress.

- **Constructor:**
  - Initializes the deployer of the contract as Spiderman and sets the game to not in progress.

- **Functions:**
  - `startGame`: Allows Spiderman to start a game by specifying a villain's address.
  - `defeatVillain`: Allows Spiderman to mark the villain as defeated and end the game.
  - `gameOver`: Used to forcefully end the game, ensuring it's in progress before doing so.
  - `callRevert`: Intentionally reverts the transaction with a custom error message.
